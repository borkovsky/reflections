When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration, access from anywhere, remote storage. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are working  on a project, or fixing something that you want to 
keep independent.
