Diff compares the lines in different files and
shows the ones that are different.

Having access to old versions of the file is good 
because you can always refer to it.
Ex. correct a mistake or look something up.

Pro of manual commits: you are in control, 
can logically separate differecnt activities.
Con: may forget to commit sometime. 

Saving multiple files in one commit is useful when
the separate files are dependent on one another (ex. html/css).

Git log is to too see all changes in history.
Git diff compares the difference between any two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?
By knowing that you can go back in time!

I want to use git to set up my github.
